When it comes to generating OG images programmatically, developers often compare different tools to find the right fit. Two popular options are **DocAPI** and **Bannerbear**. But they solve different problems.

Let's break down when to use each.

---

## What is Bannerbear?

[Bannerbear](https://www.bannerbear.com) is a template-based image generation platform. You design templates in their visual editor, then use their API to populate those templates with dynamic data.

**Best for:**
- Marketing teams generating social images at scale
- E-commerce product images with consistent branding
- Certificate or badge generation
- Video thumbnail automation

**How it works:**
1. Design a template in Bannerbear's editor
2. Define dynamic text/image layers
3. Call their API with your data
4. Receive a generated image

---

## What is DocAPI?

[DocAPI](https://www.docapi.co) is a screenshot and PDF generation API. Point it at any URL or HTML, and it captures exactly what a real browser renders.

**Best for:**
- Capturing existing web pages as OG images
- Screenshot automation for documentation
- HTML to PDF conversion
- Dynamic previews of user-generated content

**How it works:**
1. Send a URL or HTML to the API
2. Specify dimensions (1200x630 for OG images)
3. Receive a pixel-perfect screenshot

## When to Use DocAPI

### 1. You Already Have a Great Landing Page

If your website looks good, why redesign it as a template? DocAPI captures your page exactly as users see it.

```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.docapi.co/v1/screenshot', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'x-api-key': 'your-api-key',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    url: 'https://yoursite.com/blog/my-post',
    options: {
      width: 1200,
      height: 630,
      type: 'png'
    }
  })
});

const ogImage = await response.arrayBuffer();
```

### 2. Blog Post Previews

Generate OG images for blog posts automatically. Point the API at each post URL and capture the hero section.

### 3. Dynamic User Content

If users create pages, profiles, or content on your platform, screenshot those pages for social previews without maintaining templates.

### 4. Cost-Sensitive Projects

At $9/month for 1,000 screenshots vs $49/month for 1,000 images on Bannerbear, DocAPI is more economical for screenshot-based workflows.

---

## When to Use Bannerbear

### 1. Consistent Brand Templates

If every OG image needs to follow a strict brand template with specific fonts, colors, and layouts—Bannerbear's template system ensures consistency.

### 2. Data-Driven Images

Need to generate images from structured data (product name, price, rating)? Bannerbear excels at mapping data fields to image layers.

### 3. Marketing Automation

For marketing teams who need to generate hundreds of variations of the same design, Bannerbear's template approach is more efficient.

### 4. Non-Web Content

If your content doesn't exist as a web page, you'll need to design it somewhere. Bannerbear's templates work well here.

---

## The Hybrid Approach

Many teams use both:

- **DocAPI** for capturing existing pages (landing pages, blog posts, documentation)
- **Bannerbear** for marketing campaigns with strict brand templates

---

## Real Example: OG Image for This Blog

This blog post's OG image was generated using DocAPI. We simply pointed our API at the blog post URL with dimensions of 1200x630:

```javascript
await fetch('https://api.docapi.co/v1/screenshot', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'x-api-key': process.env.DOCAPI_KEY,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    url: 'https://www.docapi.co/blog/docapi-vs-bannerbear-og-images',
    options: { width: 1200, height: 630, type: 'png' }
  })
});
```

No template design. No additional tools. Just a URL and an API call.

## Conclusion

**Choose DocAPI if:**
- You want to capture existing web pages
- You need a simple, fast setup
- Budget is a concern
- You're a developer who prefers code over visual editors

**Choose Bannerbear if:**
- You need strict template-based generation
