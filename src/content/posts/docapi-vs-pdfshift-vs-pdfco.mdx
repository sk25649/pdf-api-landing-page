Choosing a PDF API shouldn't take a week of research. But with so many options, it's hard to know which one actually fits your needs.

I built DocAPI, so yes — I'm biased. But I'll give you an honest breakdown of how we compare to PDFShift and PDF.co, including where they might be better choices.

## Pricing Breakdown

### DocAPI

| Plan     | Price  | Conversions  |
| -------- | ------ | ------------ |
| Free     | $0     | 100/month    |
| Starter  | $19/mo | 1,000/month  |
| Pro      | $49/mo | 5,000/month  |
| Business | $99/mo | 20,000/month |

Simple, predictable. No credit systems. No per-page charges.

### PDFShift

| Plan       | Price  | Credits      |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------ |
| Free       | $0     | 50/month     |
| Starter    | $9/mo  | 500/month    |
| Boost      | $24/mo | 2,500/month  |
| Growth     | $39/mo | 5,000/month  |
| Enterprise | $99/mo | 15,000/month |

Credit-based. One conversion = one credit, but large PDFs can consume multiple credits.

### PDF.co

| Plan     | Price   | Credits         |
| -------- | ------- | --------------- |
| Starter  | $50/mo  | 5,000 credits   |
| Pro      | $150/mo | 25,000 credits  |
| Business | $350/mo | 100,000 credits |

No free tier. More expensive, but includes advanced features like OCR and PDF manipulation.

## When to Choose DocAPI

**You should pick DocAPI if:**

- You need simple HTML/URL to PDF conversion
- You want straightforward pricing without credit math
- You're building invoices, reports, or receipts
- You need screenshots too
- You want a generous free tier to test with

**Our focus:** Do one thing well. Fast, reliable HTML to PDF.

  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "x-api-key": "your-key",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },

    html: "<h1>Invoice #1234</h1><p>Amount: $99</p>",
  }),
});

const pdf = await response.arrayBuffer();
```

## When to Choose PDFShift

**You should pick PDFShift if:**

**Downsides:**

---

## Feature Deep Dive

### HTML to PDF Quality

All three use Chromium-based rendering, so output quality is similar. The differences:

|                      | DocAPI | PDFShift | PDF.co |
| -------------------- | ------ | -------- | ------ |
| CSS Grid/Flexbox     | ✅     | ✅       | ✅     |
| Custom Fonts         | ✅     | ✅       | ✅     |
| JavaScript Execution | ✅     | ✅       | ✅     |
| Headers/Footers      | ✅     | ✅       | ✅     |
| Page Numbers         | ✅     | ✅       | ✅     |

For basic HTML to PDF, you won't notice a difference.

### Speed

Based on converting a simple HTML invoice:

| API      | Avg Response Time |
| -------- | ----------------- |
| DocAPI   | 1.8s              |
| PDFShift | 2.5s              |
| PDF.co   | 3.2s              |

Speed matters for user-facing generation. All are acceptable, but DocAPI edges out slightly.

### API Simplicity

**DocAPI** — 3 endpoints:

- `POST /v1/pdf`
- `POST /v1/screenshot`
- `GET /v1/usage`

**PDFShift** — 2 main endpoints:

- `POST /v3/convert/pdf`
- `POST /v3/convert/screenshot`

**PDF.co** — 50+ endpoints covering every PDF operation imaginable.

If you just need HTML to PDF, DocAPI and PDFShift are simpler. If you need a full document toolkit, PDF.co wins.

## Code Comparison

### DocAPI

```javascript
const response = await fetch("https://api.docapi.co/v1/pdf", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "x-api-key": "your-key",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ html: "<h1>Hello</h1>" }),
});
```

### PDFShift

```javascript
const response = await fetch("https://api.pdfshift.io/v3/convert/pdf", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    Authorization: "Basic " + btoa("api:your-key"),
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ source: "<h1>Hello</h1>" }),
});
```

### PDF.co

```javascript
const response = await fetch("https://api.pdf.co/v1/pdf/convert/from/html", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "x-api-key": "your-key",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ html: "<h1>Hello</h1>", name: "output.pdf" }),
});
```

All straightforward. PDFShift uses Basic auth, others use API key headers.

## Honest Downsides of DocAPI

We're new. That means:

- **Smaller track record** — PDFShift has been around since 2018
- **Fewer advanced features** — no merge, split, or OCR yet
- **Smaller community** — less Stack Overflow answers about us

If you need enterprise SLAs, compliance certifications, or advanced PDF manipulation, we're not there yet.

## Migration Guide

### From PDFShift to DocAPI

```javascript
// PDFShift
const response = await fetch("https://api.pdfshift.io/v3/convert/pdf", {
  headers: { Authorization: "Basic " + btoa("api:key") },
  body: JSON.stringify({ source: html }),
});

// DocAPI — just change the URL and header
const response = await fetch("https://api.docapi.co/v1/pdf", {
  headers: { "x-api-key": "your-key" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ html: html }),
});
```

5-minute migration.

### From PDF.co to DocAPI

If you're only using HTML to PDF:

```javascript
// PDF.co
{ html: '<h1>Hello</h1>', name: 'output.pdf' }

// DocAPI
{ html: '<h1>Hello</h1>' }
```

If you're using merge, split, or OCR — stay with PDF.co. We don't have those yet.

## Decision Framework

Do you need OCR, merge, split, or form filling?
├── Yes → PDF.co
└── No
├── Is budget super tight ($9/mo)?
│ └── Yes → PDFShift Starter
└── No
├── Want simplest API + generous free tier?
│ └── DocAPI
└── Already using something that works?
└── Stay with it

---

## Try Before You Decide

All three have free tiers or trials:

- **DocAPI**: 100 free conversions/month — [docapi.co](https://docapi.co)
- **PDFShift**: 50 free conversions/month — [pdfshift.io](https://pdfshift.io)
- **PDF.co**: Free trial with limited credits — [pdf.co](https://pdf.co)

Test with your actual HTML. See which one handles your edge cases best.

## Conclusion

There's no universally "best" PDF API. It depends on what you're building:

| Use Case                | Best Choice         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| Simple invoices/reports | DocAPI or PDFShift  |
| Tight budget            | PDFShift ($9/mo)    |
| Need advanced features  | PDF.co              |
| Want generous free tier | DocAPI (100/mo)     |
| Enterprise compliance   | PDF.co or DocRaptor |

We built DocAPI because we wanted something simple that just works. If that's what you need, give us a try.

If you need more, the other options are solid too.
