## API Comparison

### DocAPI

```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.docapi.co/v1/pdf', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'x-api-key': 'your-api-key',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    html: '<h1>Hello World</h1>',
    options: {
      format: 'A4',
      margin: { top: '10mm', bottom: '10mm' }
    }
  })
});

const pdf = await response.arrayBuffer();
```

### PDFShift

```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.pdfshift.io/v3/convert/pdf', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Basic ' + btoa('api:your-api-key'),
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    source: '<h1>Hello World</h1>',
    format: 'A4',
    margin: '10mm'
  })
});

const pdf = await response.arrayBuffer();
```

Both are straightforward. DocAPI uses `x-api-key` header, PDFShift uses Basic Auth. Minor difference.

---

## When to Choose DocAPI

### 1. You Need Screenshots Too

DocAPI includes a screenshot API at no extra cost. If you need both PDFs and screenshots (like OG images), DocAPI is one API instead of two.

```javascript
// Same API, same key - just different endpoint
const screenshot = await fetch('https://api.docapi.co/v1/screenshot', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'x-api-key': 'your-api-key' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    url: 'https://example.com',
    options: { width: 1200, height: 630 }
  })
});
```

### 2. You're in the 1,000-2,500 Range

DocAPI's Starter plan ($9) includes 1,000 PDFs. PDFShift's Starter ($9) only includes 500. If you need 1,000/month, DocAPI is half the price.

### 3. You Want Simplicity

DocAPI has fewer configuration options - which is a feature, not a bug. Less to learn, fewer ways to misconfigure.

### 4. You Value Support

Smaller company = more responsive support. We actually reply to emails.

---

## When to Choose PDFShift

### 1. You Need Credit Rollover

PDFShift lets unused credits roll over to the next month. If your usage is unpredictable (100 one month, 500 the next), rollover helps.

### 2. You Need S3 Integration

PDFShift can upload generated PDFs directly to your S3 bucket. Useful for workflows where you store PDFs long-term.

### 3. You Want Batch Processing

PDFShift's parallel processing handles multiple PDFs in a single request. Good for bulk generation jobs.

### 4. You Prefer Established Companies

PDFShift has been around since 2018. If company age matters to you, they have more history.

---

## Performance

Both services use headless Chrome under the hood, so rendering quality is identical. Response times are similar:

| Metric | DocAPI | PDFShift |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Simple HTML | ~1-2s | ~1-2s |
| Complex page | ~2-4s | ~2-4s |
| With images | ~3-5s | ~3-5s |

No significant performance difference for most use cases.

---

## Migration

Switching between the two is easy since both accept HTML input:

### From PDFShift to DocAPI

```javascript
// Before (PDFShift)
fetch('https://api.pdfshift.io/v3/convert/pdf', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Basic ' + btoa('api:key') },
  body: JSON.stringify({ source: html })
})

// After (DocAPI)
fetch('https://api.docapi.co/v1/pdf', {
  headers: { 'x-api-key': 'your-key' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ html })
})
```

The main changes:
- Different endpoint
- Different auth method
- `source` → `html` parameter name

Migration takes about 10 minutes.

## The Verdict

**Choose DocAPI if:**
- You need screenshots + PDFs
- Your volume is 1,000-2,500/month
- You want a simpler API
- You value responsive support

**Choose PDFShift if:**
- You need credit rollover

**Honestly?** Both are solid products. For most developers generating PDFs, either works fine. Try both free tiers and see which feels better.
