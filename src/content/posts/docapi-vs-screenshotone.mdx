DocAPI and ScreenshotOne both help you capture web content programmatically. But they solve different problems.

I built DocAPI, so I'm biased. But I'll give you a fair comparison so you can pick the right tool.

## What Each Tool Does Best

### DocAPI: Built for Documents

DocAPI is designed for generating PDFs. If you need to create:

- Invoices and receipts
- Reports and documentation
- Contracts and proposals
- Any multi-page document

DocAPI is the better choice. We also do screenshots, but PDFs are our focus.

```javascript
// Generate a PDF with DocAPI
const response = await fetch("https://api.docapi.co/v1/pdf", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "x-api-key": "your-key",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    html: "<h1>Invoice #1234</h1><p>Total: $99</p>",
    options: { format: "A4" },
  }),
});

const pdf = await response.arrayBuffer();
```

### ScreenshotOne: Built for Screenshots

ScreenshotOne is laser-focused on screenshots. They've spent 3+ years perfecting:

- Cookie banner blocking
- Lazy-load handling
- Full-page scrolling captures
- Video rendering
- Dark mode detection

If screenshots are your core need, ScreenshotOne has more advanced features.

```javascript
// Take a screenshot with ScreenshotOne
const response = await fetch("https://api.screenshotone.com/take", {
  method: "GET",
  params: {
    url: "https://example.com",
    access_key: "your-key",
  },
});
```

## Pricing Comparison

### DocAPI

| Plan     | Price  | Conversions  |
| -------- | ------ | ------------ |
| Free     | $0     | 100/month    |
| Starter  | $19/mo | 1,000/month  |
| Pro      | $49/mo | 5,000/month  |
| Business | $99/mo | 20,000/month |

Simple per-conversion pricing. PDFs and screenshots count the same.

### ScreenshotOne

| Plan       | Price  | Screenshots  |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------ |
| Free       | $0     | 100/month    |
| Starter    | $17/mo | 1,500/month  |
| Growth     | $39/mo | 6,000/month  |
| Enterprise | $99/mo | 20,000/month |

ScreenshotOne is slightly cheaper per screenshot, especially on higher tiers.

## Feature Deep Dive

### PDF Generation

|                    | DocAPI | ScreenshotOne |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------------- |
| HTML to PDF        | ✅     | ❌            |
| URL to PDF         | ✅     | ❌            |
| Custom page size   | ✅     | ❌            |
| Headers/Footers    | ✅     | ❌            |
| Page numbers       | ✅     | ❌            |
| Multi-page support | ✅     | ❌            |

**Winner: DocAPI** — ScreenshotOne doesn't do PDFs.

### Screenshot Quality

|                   | DocAPI | ScreenshotOne |
| ----------------- | ------ | ------------- |
| Basic screenshots | ✅     | ✅            |
| Full-page scroll  | ❌     | ✅            |
| Cookie blocking   | ❌     | ✅            |
| Ad blocking       | ❌     | ✅            |
| Dark mode         | ❌     | ✅            |
| Retina/HiDPI      | ✅     | ✅            |

**Winner: ScreenshotOne** — They've specialized in this for 3+ years.

### API Simplicity

|                | DocAPI         | ScreenshotOne        |
| -------------- | -------------- | -------------------- |
| Endpoints      | 3              | 1 (with many params) |
| Auth method    | API key header | Query param          |
| Response       | Binary         | Binary or URL        |
| Learning curve | 5 minutes      | 10 minutes           |

**Winner: Tie** — Both are simple. ScreenshotOne has more options, which means more to learn but more flexibility.

## Code Comparison

### Screenshot Capture

**DocAPI:**

```javascript
const response = await fetch("https://api.docapi.co/v1/screenshot", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "x-api-key": "your-key",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    url: "https://example.com",
    options: { width: 1280, height: 800 },
  }),
});
```

**ScreenshotOne:**

```javascript
const params = new URLSearchParams({
  access_key: "your-key",
  url: "https://example.com",
  viewport_width: 1280,
  viewport_height: 800,
  block_cookie_banners: true,
  block_ads: true,
});

const response = await fetch(`https://api.screenshotone.com/take?${params}`);
```

ScreenshotOne offers more parameters out of the box.

## Honest Assessment

### Where DocAPI Wins

- **PDF generation** — ScreenshotOne simply doesn't offer this
- **Combined offering** — One API for both PDFs and screenshots
- **Simpler pricing** — Fewer tiers, easier to understand

### Where ScreenshotOne Wins

- **Screenshot features** — Cookie blocking, scrolling, video, dark mode
- **Maturity** — 3+ years of development and edge case handling
- **Slight price advantage** — More screenshots per dollar on higher tiers

### Where We're Equal

- **Free tier** — Both offer 100/month
- **API simplicity** — Both are easy to integrate
- **Reliability** — Both use Chromium-based rendering

---

## Can You Use Both?

Yes, and some teams do.

A common pattern:

- **DocAPI** for PDF generation (invoices, reports)
- **ScreenshotOne** for advanced screenshots (website galleries, monitoring)

There's nothing wrong with using the best tool for each job.

---

## The Honest Truth

If you only need screenshots with advanced features like cookie blocking and full-page scrolling, **ScreenshotOne is the better choice**. They've been at it longer and have more polish.

If you need PDF generation, or you want both PDFs and basic screenshots from one provider, **DocAPI is the better choice**.

I built DocAPI because I needed a simple PDF API. Screenshots were added because many users needed both. But I won't pretend we have screenshot feature parity with a tool that's been screenshot-focused for 3+ years.

---

## Try Both

Both have free tiers. Test with your actual use case:

- **DocAPI**: 100 free conversions/month — [docapi.co](https://docapi.co)
- **ScreenshotOne**: 100 free screenshots/month — [screenshotone.com](https://screenshotone.com)
