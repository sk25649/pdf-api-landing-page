## Quality of Output

Both tools produce professional-looking resumes. The actual PDF quality is similar:

| Aspect | DocAPI | StandOut CV |

| ATS compatibility | Yes | Yes |
| Font rendering | Clean | Clean |
| File size | Small (~50KB) | Medium (~100KB) |

The main difference: StandOut CV's free tier adds a watermark to your downloaded PDF, which looks unprofessional when submitting to employers.
