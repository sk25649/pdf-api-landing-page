## Why Use an Online Invoice Generator?

Traditional invoicing methods have problems:

- **Word/Excel templates** look unprofessional and are tedious to customize
- **Accounting software** costs $20-50/month for features you may not need
- **Manual invoices** waste time and introduce errors

Our free tool solves these issues. You fill in the details, see a live preview, and download a polished PDF.

## Step-by-Step: Creating Your First Invoice

### 1. Enter Your Company Details

Start by filling in your business information:

- **Company Name** (required) - Your business or personal name
- **Email** - Your billing contact email
- **Address** - Where payments should be sent
- **Logo** - Upload your logo (optional, max 500KB)

Your logo appears in the top-left corner of the invoice, giving it a professional, branded look.

### 2. Add Client Information

Next, enter who you're billing:

- **Client Name** (required) - The customer or company name
- **Email** - Their contact email for invoice delivery
- **Address** - Their billing address

This information appears in the "Bill To" section of the invoice.

### 3. Set Invoice Details

Configure the invoice metadata:

- **Invoice Number** - Use a consistent format like INV-001, INV-002, etc.
- **Invoice Date** - When the invoice was issued (defaults to today)
- **Due Date** - When payment is expected (defaults to 30 days out)

Consistent invoice numbering helps with record-keeping and makes you look organized.

### 4. Add Line Items

This is where you list what you're billing for. Click "Add Item" to add more rows:

- **Description** - What product or service you provided
- **Quantity** - How many units
- **Unit Price** - Price per unit

The tool automatically calculates the total for each line item and the overall subtotal.

**Example line items for a web developer:**
- Website Development - 1 - $3,000
- Monthly Hosting - 12 - $25
- Domain Registration - 1 - $15

### 5. Apply Tax Rate

Enter your tax rate as a percentage. Leave it at 0 for tax-exempt services or B2B transactions.

Check your local tax requirements to determine the correct rate for your area.

### 6. Add Notes and Payment Instructions

Include any additional information:

- **Notes** - Payment terms, thank you message, or special instructions
- **Payment Instructions** - Bank details, PayPal address, or payment link

Example notes:
```
Payment due within 30 days.
Late payments subject to 1.5% monthly interest.
Thank you for your business!
```

Example payment instructions:
```
Bank: First National Bank
Account: 1234567890
Routing: 987654321

Or pay via PayPal: billing@yourcompany.com
```

### 7. Preview and Download

As you fill in the form, watch the live preview update in real-time. This shows exactly how your PDF will look.

When you're satisfied, click **Download PDF**. The invoice downloads instantly to your device.

## Tips for Professional Invoices

### Be Specific with Descriptions

Instead of "Consulting," write "Marketing Strategy Consultation - Q4 Campaign Planning."

Specific descriptions help clients understand what they're paying for and reduce questions.

### Use Consistent Numbering

Adopt a numbering system and stick to it:
- Sequential: INV-001, INV-002, INV-003
- Date-based: INV-2024-001, INV-2024-002
- Client-based: ACME-001, ACME-002

### Set Clear Payment Terms

State when payment is due and what happens if it's late. Net 30 (30 days) is standard for most businesses.

### Include Multiple Payment Options

The easier you make it to pay, the faster you'll get paid. Include:
- Bank transfer details
- PayPal or Venmo
- Credit card payment links

### Keep Records

Save a copy of every invoice you send. You'll need them for taxes and resolving disputes.

## When to Use the Free Tool vs. API

The free invoice generator is perfect for:

- **Low volume** - A few invoices per month
- **One-off projects** - Contract work, freelance gigs
- **Getting started** - Testing invoice layouts before automating

Consider our [API](/docs) when you need:

- **Automation** - Generate invoices from your app or billing system
- **High volume** - Hundreds or thousands of invoices
- **Integration** - Connect with Stripe, your database, or CRM
- **Customization** - Fully custom HTML templates

The same technology powers both. The free tool uses DocAPI under the hood.

## Common Use Cases

### Small Businesses

Invoice customers for products or services. Include your logo for brand recognition.

### Contractors

Bill for hourly work with quantity representing hours and unit price as your hourly rate.

### Consultants

Create detailed invoices breaking down strategy sessions, deliverables, and expenses.

### Event Planners

Invoice for deposits, vendor payments, and service fees with itemized breakdowns.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is it really free?

Yes. No hidden fees, no premium tier required. Generate as many invoices as you want.

### Where is my data stored?

Nowhere. Your invoice data is sent directly to our PDF generation service and not stored on any server. Once you close the page, the data is gone.

### Can I save my company details for next time?

Currently, the tool doesn't save data between sessions. For recurring invoices, consider bookmarking with your details or using our API for automation.

### What file format is the invoice?

PDF. It's universally readable and maintains formatting across all devices.

### Can I edit an invoice after downloading?

You'll need to make changes in the form and download again. PDFs are static documents.

### Does it work internationally?

Yes. While tax rates are pre-filled for US states, you can enter custom rates for any country. Currency is displayed in USD but you can note different currencies in your descriptions.
