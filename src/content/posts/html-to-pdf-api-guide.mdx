Converting HTML to PDF is a common requirement across many industries. From generating invoices and reports to creating certificates and contracts, the ability to produce professional PDFs programmatically is essential for modern applications.

## Why Convert HTML to PDF?

HTML is the most flexible format for creating documents because:

- **Easy to create**: Use your existing web development skills
- **Dynamic content**: Generate personalized documents with data
- **Consistent styling**: CSS ensures pixel-perfect output
- **Version control**: Track changes in your templates

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Invoices and Receipts

E-commerce platforms and SaaS businesses need to generate thousands of invoices. HTML templates make it easy to maintain brand consistency while dynamically inserting customer data.

### 2. Reports and Analytics

Business intelligence tools often need to export dashboards and charts as PDFs. HTML allows you to include interactive elements that render beautifully in PDF format.

### 3. Certificates and Credentials

Educational platforms and certification bodies can generate professional certificates with custom designs, signatures, and security features.

### 4. Contracts and Legal Documents

Legal teams can automate document generation while maintaining compliance with formatting requirements.

## Approaches to HTML-to-PDF Conversion

### Browser-Based Solutions

Tools like Puppeteer and Playwright use a headless browser to render HTML and export as PDF:

**Pros:**
- Full CSS and JavaScript support
- Accurate rendering

**Cons:**
- Heavy resource usage (Chromium required)
- Slow for high-volume generation
- Complex deployment

### Server-Side Libraries

Libraries like wkhtmltopdf or WeasyPrint run on your server:

**Pros:**
- No browser dependency
- Lighter than headless browsers

**Cons:**
- Limited CSS support
- Can be difficult to install
- May produce inconsistent results

### API Services

Cloud-based APIs like Doc API handle conversion for you:

**Pros:**
- No infrastructure to manage
- Scales automatically
- Consistent, high-quality output
- Fast response times

**Cons:**
- Requires internet connection
- Per-request pricing

| Factor | Self-Hosted | API Service |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Setup Time | Hours/Days | Minutes |
| Maintenance | Ongoing | None |
| Scaling | Manual | Automatic |
| Cost at Scale | Server costs | Per-request |

      "right": "15mm"
    },
    "printBackground": true,
    "landscape": false
  }
}
```

## Tips for Better PDFs

### 1. Use Print-Specific CSS

```css
@media print {
  .no-print { display: none; }
  .page-break { page-break-before: always; }
}
```

### 2. Embed Fonts

For consistent typography, embed your fonts as base64 or use web fonts:

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;600&display=swap');

body {
  font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
}
```

### 3. Optimize Images

- Use appropriate resolution (150-300 DPI for print)
- Compress images before embedding
- Consider using SVG for logos and icons

### 4. Test Across Page Sizes

Always test your templates with different content lengths to ensure proper pagination.
