When you share a link on Twitter, LinkedIn, or Facebook, the preview image can make or break engagement. A great OG (Open Graph) image grabs attention and drives clicks.

But creating OG images is tedious. You need the right dimensions (1200x630), proper formatting, and often expensive design tools.

That's why we built a [free OG Image Generator](/tools/og-image-generator) that captures any website as a perfectly-sized OG image in seconds.

## What is an OG Image?

OG images are the preview images that appear when you share a link on social media. They're defined by the Open Graph protocol and display at **1200x630 pixels** - a 1.91:1 aspect ratio.

When your website doesn't have an OG image, social platforms either show nothing or auto-generate a poor-quality preview. Neither looks professional.

## How to Generate an OG Image

### Step 1: Go to the OG Image Generator

Visit [docapi.co/tools/og-image-generator](/tools/og-image-generator)

### Step 2: Enter Your URL

Paste the URL of any website. Let's use [Bannerbear.com](https://www.bannerbear.com) as an example - they have a beautiful landing page.

### Step 3: Click Generate

Our tool captures a screenshot at exactly 1200x630 pixels using a real browser engine. This ensures fonts, images, and animations render correctly.

### Step 4: Preview and Download

You'll see a preview of your OG image. If it looks good, click **Download PNG** to save it.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center', margin: '2rem 0'}}>
  <img src="/blog/og-image-bannerbear-example.png" alt="OG image generated from Bannerbear.com" style={{maxWidth: '100%', borderRadius: '8px', boxShadow: '0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.15)'}} />
  <p style={{fontSize: '14px', color: '#666', marginTop: '8px'}}>Example: OG image captured from Bannerbear.com</p>
</div>

## Tips for Better OG Images

### Design Above the Fold

The OG image captures the top 630 pixels of your page at 1200px width. Make sure your most important content is visible without scrolling.

### Use High Contrast

Social media feeds are busy. High contrast text and bold colors stand out more in the feed.

### Include Your Logo

Brand recognition matters. Make sure your logo is visible in the captured area.

### Test Different URLs

Try capturing different pages on your site to see which makes the best OG image.

## Automate with Our API

Need to generate OG images programmatically? Use our Screenshot API:

```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.docapi.co/v1/screenshot', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'x-api-key': 'your-api-key',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    url: 'https://www.bannerbear.com',
    options: {
      width: 1200,
      height: 630,
      type: 'png'
    }
  })
});

const ogImage = await response.arrayBuffer();
```

This is perfect for:
- Automatically generating OG images for new blog posts
- Dynamic OG images for product pages
- Building your own OG image service
