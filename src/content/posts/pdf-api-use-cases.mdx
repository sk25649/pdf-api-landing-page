Every developer eventually faces the same problem: you need to generate PDFs programmatically, and the options are either painfully complex or frustratingly limited.

PDF APIs solve this by letting you send HTML and get back a perfect PDF. No wkhtmltopdf nightmares. No Puppeteer server management. Just an API call.

Here are the most common use cases we see.

## 1. Invoices and Receipts

The most popular use case by far. E-commerce platforms, SaaS apps, and marketplaces all need to generate invoices automatically.

**Why use an API instead of a library?**

- Invoices need to look pixel-perfect
- You're already building your UI in HTML/CSS
- Handling edge cases (page breaks, multi-page invoices) is tricky

```javascript
const invoice = await fetch("https://api.yourservice.com/v1/pdf", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "x-api-key": process.env.PDF_API_KEY,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    html: renderInvoiceTemplate(orderData),
    options: { format: "A4" },
  }),
});
```

## 2. Reports and Dashboards

Analytics platforms often need to export dashboards as PDFs for stakeholders who prefer documents over live dashboards.

**Common requirements:**

- Charts and graphs render correctly
- Branding stays consistent
- Scheduled generation (weekly/monthly reports)

PDF APIs handle JavaScript-rendered charts because they use real browsers under the hood.

## 3. Contracts and Legal Documents

Legal tech, HR platforms, and real estate apps generate thousands of contracts. Each one needs to be:

- Legally formatted
- Archived as PDF/A for compliance
- Sometimes signed digitally

A PDF API lets you template once and generate infinitely.

## 4. Shipping Labels and Packing Slips

Logistics and e-commerce platforms generate labels at scale. Requirements:

- Specific dimensions (4x6" for shipping labels)
- Barcode rendering
- Batch generation (hundreds at once)

```javascript
const label = await fetch("https://api.yourservice.com/v1/pdf", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "x-api-key": process.env.PDF_API_KEY },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    html: labelTemplate,
    options: {
      width: "4in",
      height: "6in",
      margin: { top: "0.25in", bottom: "0.25in" },
    },
  }),
});
```

## 5. Tickets and Boarding Passes

Event platforms, airlines, and transit apps generate tickets with:

- QR codes or barcodes
- Specific layouts for mobile wallets
- High volume during sales spikes

## 6. Certificates and Diplomas

EdTech platforms and course providers generate completion certificates. These need:

- Custom fonts and branding
- Student-specific data
- Sometimes verification QR codes

## 7. Proposals and Quotes

Sales teams and agencies send proposals. A PDF API lets you:

- Pull data from your CRM
- Apply consistent branding
- Track when proposals are generated

## 8. Medical and Insurance Documents

Healthcare apps generate:

- Patient summaries
- Insurance claim forms
- Prescription records

Compliance matters here — PDFs provide a tamper-evident format.

## 9. Real Estate Documents

Property listings, rental agreements, and inspection reports all end up as PDFs. Agents expect them.

## 10. Resumes and Cover Letters

Job platforms and resume builders let users export their profiles. HTML-to-PDF ensures the output matches what they designed.

## When NOT to Use a PDF API

Be honest with yourself:

- **One-off PDFs**: Just use Google Docs
- **Simple text documents**: A library might be enough
- **No budget**: Self-host Puppeteer if you have DevOps capacity

## When a PDF API Makes Sense

- You're generating PDFs **programmatically** (not manually)
- Volume is **more than a few per day**
- You need **consistent, professional output**
- You'd rather **pay $19/month than manage servers**

## Getting Started

Most PDF APIs work the same way:

1. Sign up and get an API key
2. Send HTML in a POST request
3. Receive PDF bytes back

Here's a complete Node.js example:

```javascript
async function generateInvoice(order) {
  const html = `
    <html>
      <head>
        <style>
          body { font-family: sans-serif; padding: 40px; }
          h1 { color: #333; }
          table { width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; }
          th, td { padding: 12px; border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; text-align: left; }
        </style>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Invoice #${order.id}</h1>
        <p>Date: ${new Date().toLocaleDateString()}</p>
        <table>
          <tr><th>Item</th><th>Qty</th><th>Price</th></tr>
          ${order.items
            .map(
              (item) => `
            <tr>
              <td>${item.name}</td>
              <td>${item.quantity}</td>
              <td>$${item.price}</td>
            </tr>
          `
            )
            .join("")}
        </table>
        <p><strong>Total: $${order.total}</strong></p>
      </body>
    </html>
  `;

  const response = await fetch("https://api.yourservice.com/v1/pdf", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "x-api-key": process.env.PDF_API_KEY,
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ html }),
  });

  return response.arrayBuffer();
}
```

## Conclusion

PDF APIs aren't revolutionary — they just save you time. If you're generating documents programmatically and want them to look good without the infrastructure headache, an API is the right call.

Pick a use case, start with a free tier, and scale from there.
