You need to capture something programmatically. But should you generate a PDF or take a screenshot?

Both convert HTML to a downloadable file. Both use headless browsers under the hood. But they solve different problems.

Here's how to choose.

## The Core Difference

|                     | PDF API                        | Screenshot API             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| **Output**          | Multi-page document            | Single image               |
| **Format**          | .pdf                           | .png, .jpg, .webp          |
| **Best for**        | Documents meant to be read     | Visuals meant to be seen   |
| **Page breaks**     | Yes, handled automatically     | No concept of pages        |
| **File size**       | Smaller for text-heavy content | Smaller for simple visuals |
| **Searchable text** | Yes                            | No (it's an image)         |

## When to Use a PDF API

### 1. Invoices and Receipts

PDFs are the standard for financial documents. They're:

- Printable at any size without quality loss
- Searchable (find that transaction from 6 months ago)
- Archivable for compliance

```javascript
const invoice = await fetch("https://api.docapi.co/v1/pdf", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "x-api-key": "your-key" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    html: invoiceTemplate,
    options: { format: "A4" },
  }),
});
```

### 2. Reports and Documentation

Multi-page content belongs in PDFs. A 20-page analytics report as a screenshot would be absurd.

### 3. Contracts and Legal Documents

Legal documents need to be:

- Paginated properly
- Text-selectable for copying clauses
- Consistent across all devices

### 4. Anything That Gets Printed

If the end user might print it, use PDF. Screenshots pixelate when printed at larger sizes.

---

## When to Use a Screenshot API

### 1. Social Media Previews (Open Graph Images)

When someone shares your link on Twitter or LinkedIn, you need an image — not a PDF.

```javascript
const ogImage = await fetch("https://api.docapi.co/v1/screenshot", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "x-api-key": "your-key" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    html: ogTemplate,
    options: {
      width: 1200,
      height: 630,
      format: "png",
    },
  }),
});
```

### 2. Website Thumbnails

Link preview tools, bookmarking apps, and dashboards show website thumbnails. These are always images.

### 3. Email Content

Most email clients don't render PDFs inline. But images? They display perfectly.

### 4. App Store / Marketing Assets

Screenshots of your product for landing pages, pitch decks, or the App Store.

### 5. Automated Testing Evidence

QA teams capture screenshots to document bugs or verify UI states.

### 6. Charts and Graphs as Images

Sometimes you need to embed a chart in a doc or email. Exporting as PNG is cleaner than embedding a PDF.

---

## The Hybrid Use Case: PDF with Screenshot Elements

Sometimes you need both.

**Example:** A weekly report PDF that includes a screenshot of a live dashboard.

1. Screenshot the dashboard
2. Embed the image in your HTML template
3. Generate the PDF

```javascript
// Step 1: Capture dashboard
const dashboardImage = await fetch("https://api.docapi.co/v1/screenshot", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "x-api-key": "your-key" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    url: "https://app.example.com/dashboard",
    options: { width: 1200, height: 800 },
  }),
});

const imageBase64 = Buffer.from(await dashboardImage.arrayBuffer()).toString(
  "base64"
);

// Step 2: Generate PDF with embedded image
const report = await fetch("https://api.docapi.co/v1/pdf", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "x-api-key": "your-key" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    html: `
      <h1>Weekly Report</h1>
      <p>Dashboard snapshot as of ${new Date().toLocaleDateString()}</p>
      <img src="data:image/png;base64,${imageBase64}" />
    `,
    options: { format: "A4" },
  }),
});
```

## Quick Decision Framework

Ask yourself these questions:

### Will it be printed?

→ **PDF**

### Is it multi-page?

→ **PDF**

### Does it need searchable text?

→ **PDF**

### Is it for social sharing?

→ **Screenshot**

### Will it be embedded in another app/email?

→ **Screenshot**

### Is it a visual snapshot of a specific moment?

→ **Screenshot**

## Technical Differences

### File Size

| Content Type         | PDF    | PNG     |
| -------------------- | ------ | ------- |
| Text-heavy invoice   | ~50KB  | ~200KB  |
| Simple chart         | ~100KB | ~50KB   |
| Full webpage capture | ~200KB | ~500KB+ |

PDFs compress text efficiently. Screenshots compress simple graphics better.

### Rendering Time

Screenshots are usually faster — they just capture what's visible.

PDFs take slightly longer because they need to:

- Calculate page breaks
- Render headers/footers per page
- Generate the PDF structure

For most use cases, the difference is negligible (both under 2 seconds).

### Resolution

|                    | PDF              | Screenshot          |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| **Scaling**        | Vector, infinite | Raster, fixed       |
| **Retina support** | Automatic        | Requires 2x capture |
| **Print quality**  | Always crisp     | Can pixelate        |

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Using PDFs for Email Thumbnails

Emails can't display PDFs inline. Use screenshots.

### Mistake 2: Using Screenshots for Multi-Page Documents

A 10-page report as a single tall image? Nobody wants to scroll that.

### Mistake 3: Capturing Full-Page Screenshots for Everything

`fullPage: true` creates massive images for long pages. Usually you want a fixed viewport.

### Mistake 4: Forgetting Mobile Dimensions

If your content will be viewed on mobile, set appropriate viewport sizes:

```javascript
// For mobile screenshot
options: {
  width: 390,   // iPhone 14 width
  height: 844
}
```

---

## Pricing Consideration

Most API providers charge per conversion. PDFs and screenshots typically cost the same per call.

But if you're generating thousands:

- Screenshots of simple pages are faster → potentially lower costs on time-based billing
- PDFs with many pages count as one conversion → better value for long documents

---

## Conclusion

**Use PDF when:**

- Document will be printed, archived, or signed
- Content spans multiple pages
- Text needs to be searchable/selectable

**Use Screenshot when:**

- Output is for visual display (social, email, thumbnails)
- You need a specific viewport capture
- You're embedding in another image-based context

Most apps eventually need both. That's why we offer both endpoints under one API key.

## Try It

Generate your first PDF:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.docapi.co/v1/pdf \
  -H "x-api-key: your-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"html": "<h1>Hello PDF</h1>"}' \
  --output test.pdf
```

Capture your first screenshot:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.docapi.co/v1/screenshot \
  -H "x-api-key: your-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://example.com", "options": {"width": 1280, "height": 800}}' \
  --output test.png
```

Both take seconds to set up. Pick the right tool for your use case.
